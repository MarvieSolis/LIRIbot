## The Function of This Program
This program is ran through Node on terminal. The user can enter 4 commands. These being "my-tweets", "spotify-this-song", "movie-this", and "do-what-it-says". "my-tweets" utilizes the twitter API and gets the 20 most recent tweets from a user. "spotify-this-song" is followed by a user entered song name and utilizes the spotify API to retrieve a song and information about it. "movie-this" is followed by a user entered movie title and utilizes the OMDB API and retrieves data about the user desired movie. "do-what-it-says" will conduct a random command based on the random.txt file. All results are recorded onto a log.txt file using *fs.appendFile*.


## The Usefulness
This program combines 3 APIs into one, giving the user the ability to access information from OMDB, spotify, and twitter from the same application. Upon inspection of the code, users can learn how to utilize the API's documentations and how the information is retrieved and documented.
